various cool projects in here, three data structures with underlying algorithms built in. List.c is a completely functional doubly linked list data structure that was used to lexicographically sort any file (used insertion sort here)
GraphBFS.c utilizes Graph theory, creating arc and edges with the purpose of being able to find the shortest possible path between nodes. 
Graph.c also utilizes Graph theory, with the capability to track down any strongly connected components. 
need to fix minor memory leaks, other than that these structures are perfectly useable for any client that imports the header files.
